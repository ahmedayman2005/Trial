It comes with a cool web app built with Streamlit, so you can try it out yourself.


## Features

- 🚕 **Precise Predictions with Ridge Regression**: Optimized for accuracy using RandomizedSearchCV.  
- 🌟 **Innovative Feature Engineering**: Custom features like Haversine/Manhattan distances, time-of-day segmentation, and rush-hour flags.  
- 🌐 **Interactive Streamlit Interface**: Predict trip durations with ease.  
- 📊 **Comprehensive Metrics Display**: RMSE, R², and MAE for train, validation, and test sets.  
- 📈 **Scalable Framework**: Easily adaptable for other cities or datasets.

## Usage

1. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
2. **Start the Streamlit application:**
   ```bash
   streamlit run Streamlit.py
3. **Open your web browser and go to:**

## Model Details

- **Model**: Ridge Regression with an optimized alpha parameter, fine-tuned using RandomizedSearchCV. 
- **Features**:  
  - **Haversine Distance**: Measures the real-world distance between pickup and dropoff points.  
  - **Manhattan Distance**: Captures NYC’s grid-like street layout for more accurate distance estimates.  
  - **Distance Per Hour**: Adjusts distance based on the time of day to reflect speed variations.  
  - **Time of Day**: Segments trips into morning, midday, evening, night, or late-night to capture temporal patterns.  
  - **Rush Hour Flag**: Identifies peak traffic hours (7-10 AM, 4-7 PM) to adjust predictions.  
  - **Weekend Flag**: Accounts for different traffic patterns on weekends.  
- **Objective**: Maximize the R² score through  feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning.
